Google Chrome extension to listen to Radio Paradise
===================================================

Very simple [Chrome extension][webstore] to simplify listening of [Radio Paradise][rp].

It provide a button on the right of the address bar with following functionality:

- If Radio Paradise (or other site) plays music in some tab, it switches to this tab
- If Radio Paradise plays in current tab, it switches back to previous active tab
- If there is not Radio Paradise tabs, it creates new tab with Radio Paradise and switches to it

It makes easy (1) to open Radio Paradise, and (2) to take a look at Radio Paradise
tab and get back to previous active tab.

Historically...
---------------

...it was (at 2014) a rich player based on PR API and streams. But in course of time
native RP player became much more powerful. In 2019 I decided to rewrite this extension
to very simple way, just to simplify listening RP, using the native player.

All source code of rich player still available in GitHub history.
