Google Chrome extension to listen to Radio Paradise
===================================================

Very simple extension to slimplify listening of Radio Paradise.

It provide pure buttom at the right of the address bar with following functionality:

- If RP (or other site) plays music in some tab, it switch to this tab
- If RP plays in current tab, it switchs back to previos active tab
- If there is not RP tabs, it create new tab with RP and switch to it

It makes easy (1) to open Radio Paradise, and (2) to qiuck look to RP tab and return back.

Historically...
---------------

...it was (at 2014) a rich player based on PR API and streams. But in course of time
native RP player become much more powerful. In 2019 I decide to rewrite this extension
to very simple way, just to simplify listning RP, using there native player.

All source code of rich player still available in GitHub history.
